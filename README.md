# Interview-Projects
These are various projects that I have undertaken in my own time to help develop my skills in data science. This way, I am able to showcase with the hope to create insights  to individuals. 

1. First two projects being 911 calls and Movies Correlation focused on simple data analysis and data exploration.
2. K-Means Clustering is my first machine learning application to a market segmentation focused dataset
