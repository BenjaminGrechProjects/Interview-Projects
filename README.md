# Interview-Projects
These are various projects that I have undertaken in my own time to help develop my skills in data science. This way, I aspire to create valuable insights that will make someone will think "oh thats cool". 

1. First two projects being 911 calls and Movies Correlation focused on simple data analysis and data exploration.
2. K-Means Clustering is my first machine learning application to a market segmentation focused dataset
